Hi there! I am Nuria Oyaga. Welcome to my About Me page.

I am currently working on European projects and taking my first steps to enter the university world.

At this moment my computer science interests lie in deep learning, computer vision, and robotics, aligned with learning the latest technologies in these fields and code development.

In addition, and putting computer science aside, I am passionate about scuba diving and I love listening to music, watching series and watching football.
